The goal of isstatic is to provide a convenient set of static functions for checking object class inheritance, regex pattern matching, extracting attributes, and basic type conversion.

I've used and reused these functions across a number of different packages so using [staticimports](https://github.com/wch/staticimports) is also intended as a way to keep those functions standardized across projects. This package is inspired by the [stringstatic](https://github.com/rossellhayes/stringstatic/) package by  Alex Rossell Hayes.

## Installation

You can install the development version of isstatic like so:

``` r
pak::pkg_install("elipousson/isstatic")
```
## Usage

To import functions from `isstatic` into your package, put a comment block starting with `# @staticimports pkg:isstatic` in one of your R source files.

For example, your `utils.R` file may have this at the top:

```
# @staticimports pkg:isstatic
#  is_sf is_bbox is_url
```

`pkg:isstatic` means you will import functions from the `stringstatic` package.
You can find many other useful functions in [`pkg:staticimports`](https://github.com/wch/staticimports).

Subsequent lines list the objects to import from the package.
In this case, they are `is_sf()`, `is_bbox()` and `is_url()`.

To perform the import, run:

```r
staticimports::import()
```

By default, this will write the functions to an `R/staticimports.R` file in your project.
