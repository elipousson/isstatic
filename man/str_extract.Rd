}
\usage{
str_extract(string, pattern)
}
\arguments{
\item{string}{Input vector.
Either a character vector, or something coercible to one.}

\item{pattern}{Pattern to look for.

The default interpretation is a regular expression,
as described in \link[base:regex]{base::regex}.
Control options with \code{\link[=regex]{regex()}}.

Match a fixed string (i.e. by comparing only bytes), using \code{\link[=fixed]{fixed()}}.
This is fast, but approximate.}
}
\value{
A character matrix.
The first column is the complete match,
followed by one column for each capture group.
